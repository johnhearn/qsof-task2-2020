# QSOF - Task 2

This is my submission for the QSOF [Quantum Computing Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/).

I have chosen to attempt Task 2 of the screening challenges. 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which attacks the first part of the task by sampling the probability distribution on a noisy circuit using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [QisKit](https://qiskit.org/) simulator.

A second notebook responds to the "bonus question" with a more in-depth theoretical approach to VQE using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language and the [Yao.jl](https://yaoquantum.org/) simulator.

There is an additional branch `extra` where I've added more experiments related to this and other tasks.
